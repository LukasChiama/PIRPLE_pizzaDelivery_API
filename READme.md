This repo is code for assignment number two on the Node.JS Master Class. It is an API for a pizza delivery company that allows creating of new users with a valid email address and other crud operations on the users. It allows users to create, get, extend and delete tokens for logging in. S logged in user can get the pizza menu available, create, see, edit and delete pizza orders and also pay for a pizza delivery with his card. When a user pays, the card provided is charged using the Stripe payment API and the user is sent an email with the payment details using the MailGun mail API.

The Assignment (Scenario):

You are building the API for a pizza-delivery company. Don't worry about a frontend, just build the API. Here's the spec from your project manager: 

1. New users can be created, their information can be edited, and they can be deleted. We should store their name, email address, and street address.

2. Users can log in and log out by creating or destroying a token.

3. When a user is logged in, they should be able to GET all the possible menu items (these items can be hardcoded into the system). 

4. A logged-in user should be able to fill a shopping cart with menu items

5. A logged-in user should be able to create an order. You should integrate with the Sandbox of Stripe.com to accept their payment. Note: Use the stripe sandbox for your testing. Follow this link and click on the "tokens" tab to see the fake tokens you can use server-side to confirm the integration is working: https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards

6. When an order is placed, you should email the user a receipt. You should integrate with the sandbox of Mailgun.com for this. Note: Every Mailgun account comes with a sandbox email account domain (whatever@sandbox123.mailgun.org) that you can send from by default. So, there's no need to setup any DNS for your domain for this task https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/faqs.html#how-do-i-pick-a-domain-name-for-my-mailgun-account
